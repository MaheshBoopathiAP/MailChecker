**SentMailChecker**

SentMailChecker is a web tool that helps you keep your outreach lists clean and focused by processing Excel or CSV files with contact data, checking whether emails have already been sent, and returning a filtered file for future use.

‚≠ê Features

Checks which emails have already been sent (cross-references your data/server/logs as per your backend).

Removes already-emailed contacts automatically.

Provides a filtered file for download (Excel), so you only keep leads who still need to be contacted.
